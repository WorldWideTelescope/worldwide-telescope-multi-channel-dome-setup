# Edge Points {#edge-points}

_Setting Edge Points._

1.  Set edge points. These mark places on the dome where one projector overlaps anotherâ€™s edge.
    1.  Turn on Calibration Screens
    2.  Toggling between Black and White background can be helpful for lining up points
    3.  Outlines will put a red outline around each channel in the dome. If you have physical masks installed you may not see these.
    4.  Select the edges you wish to work on in left Point Pane. After clicking on a point set the two edges will highlight in the example pane
    5.  Right click and select add
    6.  You will see two points populate, one for each edge in red and green
    7.  Left click will control a red point

_Selecting Calibration Scenes.._

*   1.  Right click will control a green point
    2.  Align center X on top of each other in roughly the center of the blend region
    3.  Must physically be inside dome with optical blends in place to see if placement is correct
    4.  Complete this process for each edge, and add any edges that are not pre populated
    5.  Ensure there are no incorrect points left
        1.  These will have the same coordinates for each point (example: [960.540, 960.540])
        2.  These points will cause a singularity when trying to solve alignment.
        3.  Delete any points like this before solving alignment
