_Setting Edge Points._
![](assets/edgepoints.jpg)

1.  Set edge points. These mark places on the dome where one projector overlaps anotherâ€™s edge.
    -  Turn on Calibration Screens
    -  Toggling between Black and White background can be helpful for lining up points
    -  Outlines will put a red outline around each channel in the dome. If you have physical masks installed you may not see these.
    -  Select the edges you wish to work on in left Point Pane. After clicking on a point set the two edges will highlight in the example pane
    -  Right click and select add
    -  You will see two points populate, one for each edge in red and green
    -  Left click will control a red point <br>
      _Selecting Calibration Scenes_

    -  Right click will control a green point
    -  Align center X on top of each other in roughly the center of the blend region
    -  Must physically be inside dome with optical blends in place to see if placement is correct
    -  Complete this process for each edge, and add any edges that are not pre populated
    -  Ensure there are no incorrect points left
      1.  These will have the same coordinates for each point (example: [960.540, 960.540])
      2.  These points will cause a singularity when trying to solve alignment.
      3.  Delete any points like this before solving alignment:
