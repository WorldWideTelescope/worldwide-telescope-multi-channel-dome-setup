WorldWide Telescope (WWT) is a free program designed to give users the ability
to explore the universe in a simple easy to use interface. Recently support
has been developed to include a variety of playback mediums. This document
will detail the steps required for a multi-channel display setup for use in a
dome or frustum environment.

It is recommended before attempting to setup a multi-channel system that you
familiarize yourself with WWT as a system. There are many introductory tours
that will help in this process that are included with the software.

WWT is an ever evolving program and the steps, descriptions, and information
contained in this guide is subject to change at any time.

Parts of this guide work on the premise that you have the required data
regarding projector positioning and field of view/aspect ratio. Please obtain
these data before attempting to start this process.
