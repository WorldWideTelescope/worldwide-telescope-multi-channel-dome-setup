The free and open-source AAS WorldWide Telescope software can power
planetarium systems ranging from portable inflatable domes to high-end,
multi-channel venues. This guide covers the specialized topics that can arise
when using WWT in a planetarium setting, such as
[projector alignment](@/multi-channel-setup/_index.md),
[setting up specialized controllers](@/controllers/_index.md), and
[performance optimization](@/performance/_index.md).

You can learn about how to create custom scripted shows for playback in WWT in
the [Tour Authoring Guide], with support from the [Layer Guide] and
[Data Guide] on the details of creating and including custom visual elements
in your tours. The [WWT User Manual] introduces WWT and covers the nooks and
crannies of the user interface of the WWT Windows application.
