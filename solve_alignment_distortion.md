# Solve Alignment/Distortion {#solve-alignment-distortion}

1.  Use WWT to solve the alignment
    1.  Click Solve Distortion.
    2.  WWT will use algorithms to solve alignment showing its average error and keep cycling until there is no better solution.
    3.  3.0 or better for an average error is preferred
